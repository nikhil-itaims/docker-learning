# A brief description on Docker

This repository is a hands-on introduction to Docker concepts. It serves as a learning resource for myself (and anyone else who wants to join!) as we explore the capabilities of Docker.

**Focus Areas:**

- Building multi-stage Dockerfiles for efficient images
- Managing persistent data with volumes
- Creating isolated network configurations
- Managing multi-container applications with Docker Compose (and potentially more advanced topics in the future)

**Tutorials:**

Each tutorial will showcase a Dockerfile with a simple Python application (since I'm a Python engineer), demonstrating key Docker concepts. Feel free to adapt these examples and create your own Dockerfiles using PHP, Node.js, or any technology you prefer!

For any questions or feedback about this repository, feel free to reach out to me. You can get my contact details from my GitHub profile.
